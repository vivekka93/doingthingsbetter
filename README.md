This repository is about what India is doing wrong and how things can be done better, by going back to the roots of
basic sciences, common sense, and fundamental thinking.

I take this as an incentive to learn few languages, frameworks, concepts and everything I've always wanted to do.

Few of the things I hope I'll learn/ improve in the process of building this project:
scraping, building web sites, ml, frontend etc.
